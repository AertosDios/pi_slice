# pi_slice
A portable Raspberry Pi project! Somewhere between a phone and a tablet, with the maker/tinkerer in mind. 
Linux on the go, in an ultraportable, but usable, formfactor with endless modularity.
General Idea:
A small portable cyber deck for your average console cowboy. 
An all in one, everything you need and nothing you don't machine .
Open ended design for increased DIY versitiliy.
Made to be iterated and improved for specific use cases.

Current Progress - 
Stage 1
First prototype built, ironing out some kinks for v0.2

Stages - 
1. Prototyping / Developing Hardware/ Interfacing
2. Modular / Maker model with 4B+ as main board. 
3. Software development / Product analysis
4. Integrate hardware further
5. Modular / Dev model with CM4 as mainboard


Influences - 
Heavily influeced by modern cyberdecks and the cyberpunk genre...
